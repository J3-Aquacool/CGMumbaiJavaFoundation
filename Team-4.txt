Average of Multiples
*******************

Create a java program to calculate the average of even multiples of 3 stored in an array

Create the following static method in the given class Source

static int findAverage(int[])  



Method should calculate and return the average of specific integers present in the input array. Only integers that are even multiples of 3, should be considered for the average calculation
negative integers should be ignored in the average calculation
The average should be rounded to the nearest integer
If the input array is null or empty, average should be zero


*Do the following in the main method *



main method should accept input through console
The first input 'n' represents the number of integers in the array, followed by n integers
Create the array and find the average by invoking the static method
Print the returned average as per the sample output format 


Example
Sample Input:
5
6 9 12 -6 10

Expected Output:
Average : 9

Sample Input:
4
-6 -12 -3 4

Expected Output:
Average : 0
